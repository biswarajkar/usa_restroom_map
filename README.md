# Public Restrooms in the US
A GIS solution using ArcGIS 10.3 to map public restrooms in the USA. Mapped more than 2500 restrooms aiming to help Transgenger/LGBTQ+ people looking for gender neutral restrooms, patients with Overactive Bladder &amp; other restroom challenged persons.

This is an ongoing project, the current project was made using ArcGIS 10, however, I am working on moving the project to a WebApp solution accessible on phone/tablet/browser. Stay tuned. If you are a MobileApp developer and are interested to collaborate, please [email](mailto:biswaraj.kar@gmail.com?Subject=Collaboration%20for%20USA%20Restroom%20Map) me.
